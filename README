Written because we got sick of Metasploit PSExec getting popped

Special thanks to Carnal0wnage who's blog inspired us to go this route.

v1.2.5 - 02/19/2013
FIXED - Issues with proper mingw identification, especially for 64 Bit systems
UPDATE - Installer was updated with extra prereqs for winexe compilation.
TESTING - Install and execution of smbexec was tested again on Ubuntu 12.04 and Fedora 17 64Bit systems

v1.2.4 - 02/04/2013
UPDATE - Added UAC functionality. Now you can check systems to see if they have UAC enabled. In addition, you can disable or enable UAC on systems
v1.2.3 - 01/20/2013
UPDATE - Changed menu layout, was getting crowded on the main page. Combined like tasks.
FIXED - Hash folder creation wasn't checking for existing folder before trying to create. Resulted in error message.

v1.2.2 - 01/17/2013
UPDATE - Check credentials for remote login capabilities
UPDATE - Checks systems for DA/EA users logged in or running processes
UPDATE - If wce.exe is place in the smbexec/progs/ directory it will upload and execute on the target to obtain cleartext credentials from memory during hash grab

NOTE: The wce.exe file that exists in the progs directory has been obfuscated and is included in smbexec with written permission from the copyright owner Hernan Ochoa.
Hernan retains all rights to the Windows Credential Editor and can ask to have the program removed from smbexec distribution at any time. We'd like to than Hernan for letting us include his incredibly awesome tool for distribution.

v1.2.0 - 11/30/2012
FIXED - Script now checks to ensure exe's are compile before running. Alerts user to use installer to compile.
UPDATE - Added drive and path variables to ntds hash grab function. (No longer hardcoded to C:\Windows\NTDS or C:\Windows\Temp)
UPDATE - Checks for available diskspace before copying ntds.dit and sys files to the path provided
UPDATE - Deletes the volume shadow copy created by the ntds hash grab function

v1.1.1 - 11/11/2012
FIXED - Sometimes the IP validation fails even though it is a proper IP address
UPDATE - Installer updated with Samba-3.6.9 source
UPDATE - libesedb project moved to Google Code, installer updated with proper path  

Includes
- smbexec.sh
- installer.sh
- patches to compile binaries
- source for samba-3.6.9 and winexe-1.00

Just run the installer and you should be good to go! If not email me....jbrav.hax@gmail.com
- Run option #1 to compile binaries before you do anything!
*** If there are no binaries...the program will not work***
Sounds simple enough
